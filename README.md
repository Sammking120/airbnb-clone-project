# Project Description
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application that emulates Airbnb's core functionality, enabling users to register, list properties, book stays, and leave reviews. Built with technologies like Django, MySQL etc, the project focuses on backend development, secure API design, database architecture, and CI/CD deployment. It serves as a practical environment for collaborative software development, emphasizing real-world skills like system design, authentication, and scalable deployment.
