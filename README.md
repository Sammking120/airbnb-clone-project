## üöÄ  CI/CD Pipeline
It is an acronym that stands for continuous integration and continuous deployment, which is a modern DevOps practice that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying software efficiently and reliably.
**Importance of CI/CD**
1. It accelerates Development cycles
2. Reduces risks in Deployment because the rollback mechanism reduces downtime
3. Improved Code quality and stability
4. Enhanced team collaboration
5. Scalability and Business Agility
6. Security and compliance
   
**Tools**
   * GitHub Actions: Automates workflows for testing and deployment.
